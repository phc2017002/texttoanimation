00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,575
Welcome to this comprehensive explanation of the Schrödinger equation, one

2
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:08,934
of the most fundamental equations in quantum mechanics. This equation

3
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:12,535
describes how quantum systems evolve over time and is the

4
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:16,200
cornerstone of our understanding of the microscopic world.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,832
Let's begin with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in its

6
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,292
most general form. This elegant equation connects the energy

7
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,656
of a quantum system to its wave function.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,860
Here is the equation: i times h-bar times the partial derivative of

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,322
psi with respect to time equals the Hamiltonian operator acting on psi.

10
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,259
Let's break down each component of this equation.

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,841
First, we have i, the imaginary unit, which

12
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:45,164
indicates that quantum mechanics fundamentally involves complex numbers.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,126
Next is h-bar, the reduced Planck constant, which connects the

14
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:53,809
quantum world to our macroscopic measurements. Its value is approximately

15
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,696
1.054 times 10 to the minus 34 joule seconds.

16
00:00:56,783 --> 00:01:00,481
Psi is the wave function, which contains all the information about the

17
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,736
quantum state of our system. This is what we're solving for.

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,341
The Hamiltonian operator H-hat represents the total energy

19
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,514
of the system, including both kinetic and potential

20
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:13,189
energy. For a particle, it takes this form.

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,814
Now let's explore wave functions in detail. The

22
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:20,669
wave function psi is a complex-valued function that

23
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:23,020
describes the quantum state of a particle.

24
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,127
A wave function can be written as psi of x and t, which

25
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:30,200
depends on both position and time. Let's visualize what this looks like.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,247
Since the wave function is complex, we can separate

27
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,996
it into real and imaginary parts. Here we show

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,506
a simple example: a traveling wave packet.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,549
The blue curve represents the real part of the wave

30
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,257
function, while the red curve shows the imaginary part. Notice

31
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:48,426
how they oscillate together, creating a complex wave.

32
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:51,393
An important property of wave functions is that they

33
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:54,541
must be normalized. This means the total probability of

34
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:57,690
finding the particle somewhere in space must equal one.

35
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:03,191
The wave function itself is not directly observable, but its

36
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,699
square modulus gives us the probability density. This is one

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,740
of the most important concepts in quantum mechanics.

38
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,247
The probability density is defined as the absolute square of

39
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:16,644
the wave function. Mathematically, we write it as psi star

40
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,163
times psi, or the magnitude of psi squared.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,965
Let's visualize this concept. Here we show the wave

42
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,497
function on top and the corresponding probability density below.

43
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:29,327
For this Gaussian wave packet, the wave function oscillates both

44
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:34,073
positively and negatively. However, the probability density is always positive,

45
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:37,316
as it must be, since probabilities cannot be negative.

46
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:41,482
The area under the probability density curve represents the probability of

47
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:44,916
finding the particle in a given region. The shaded green area

48
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,843
shows where the particle is most likely to be found.

49
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:53,481
One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics is how

50
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,304
wave functions evolve in time. Let's see this evolution in action.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,524
For a free particle, the wave function spreads out over

52
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:03,513
time. This is called wave packet spreading and is a

53
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:07,148
purely quantum mechanical phenomenon with no classical analog.

54
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,019
At time t equals zero, we start with a narrow wave

55
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:14,003
packet centered at the origin. Watch what happens as time progresses.

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,294
As time increases, the wave packet spreads

57
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,644
out and becomes wider. The particle becomes

58
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:21,758
delocalized, with increasing uncertainty in its position.

59
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,246
This spreading is governed by the Heisenberg

60
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,026
uncertainty principle. As the wave packet spreads

61
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:30,657
in position, the momentum uncertainty increases correspondingly.

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,555
Let's discuss the physical interpretation of the Schrödinger equation

63
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:39,102
and what it tells us about the quantum world.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,386
The Schrödinger equation is a wave equation, similar to

65
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:46,031
the equations describing sound waves or water waves. However,

66
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:49,496
it describes probability waves rather than physical waves.

67
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,750
Unlike classical particles which have definite positions and

68
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,909
momenta, quantum particles are described by wave functions

69
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,122
that give probabilities for different measurement outcomes.

70
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:04,753
Let's examine a concrete example: the particle in a box. This is

71
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:08,901
one of the most important exactly solvable problems in quantum mechanics.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,974
Imagine a particle confined between two infinitely high potential walls. The

73
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,847
particle can only exist between x equals zero and x equals

74
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:20,184
L, where L is the width of the box.

75
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:23,693
The solutions to the Schrödinger equation in this case are

76
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:27,265
standing waves, similar to the modes of a vibrating string.

77
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:30,109
The wave functions are given by sine functions.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,646
Here is the ground state, where n equals one. This

79
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:35,141
is the lowest energy state the particle can have.

80
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,080
The first excited state has n equals two, with one

81
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,204
node in the middle. Notice how the wave function goes

82
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:44,563
to zero at the walls, satisfying the boundary conditions.

83
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,075
And here is the n equals three state, with two

84
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:50,479
nodes. Each successive state has higher energy and more nodes.

85
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:55,602
The corresponding energies are quantized, meaning they can only take certain discrete

86
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,805
values. This is given by the formula E sub n equals n

87
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:02,430
squared times h-bar squared pi squared over two m L squared.

88
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:08,999
Let's summarize what we've learned about the Schrödinger equation

89
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,417
and its profound implications for our understanding of nature.

90
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:15,764
First, the Schrödinger equation is the fundamental equation

91
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,827
of quantum mechanics. It describes how quantum systems

92
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,324
evolve in time through their wave functions.

93
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,364
Second, wave functions contain all information about

94
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:27,001
a quantum system, but they are complex-valued

95
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,459
probability amplitudes, not directly measurable quantities.

96
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,734
Third, the probability density, given by the absolute square

97
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,416
of the wave function, tells us where we're likely

98
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:39,044
to find a particle when we measure its position.

99
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:43,202
Finally, quantum mechanics fundamentally differs from classical physics.

100
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,677
Particles don't have definite properties until measured, and

101
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:49,978
observation plays a crucial role in determining outcomes.

102
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:54,737
The Schrödinger equation has been incredibly successful, explaining phenomena

103
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:58,889
from atomic spectra to chemical bonding, semiconductor physics, and

104
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,173
even the behavior of exotic materials. It remains one

105
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:05,457
of the cornerstones of modern physics and technology.

106
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,977
Thank you for watching this exploration of the

107
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,945
Schrödinger equation. The quantum world is strange and

108
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,462
counterintuitive, but also beautiful and mathematically elegant.
