00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,625
Welcome. Today, we dive into the heart of quantum

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:06,518
mechanics: The Schrödinger Equation. In classical physics, we describe

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,520
a ball by its position and momentum.

4
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,553
But in the quantum world, objects like electrons are not

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:15,132
just particles; they are described by a mathematical object called

6
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:17,790
a Wave Function, denoted by the Greek letter Psi.

7
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:23,059
This is the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation. It tells us how the wave

8
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:26,750
function changes over time. Let's break it down piece by piece.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,148
First, we have i, the imaginary unit, and

10
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:33,599
h-bar, the reduced Planck's constant. These constants scale

11
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,056
the equation, linking energy to frequency.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,027
Next is the partial derivative with respect to time. This

13
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,744
represents the rate of change of the system's state.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,443
On the right side, we have H-hat, the Hamiltonian operator. This

15
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:49,674
represents the total energy of the system: kinetic plus potential energy.

16
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,148
But what is Psi? Physically, it's a complex

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,322
probability amplitude. It can be positive, negative, or

18
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:59,208
even imaginary. Here is a real part visualization.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,994
The quantity that we actually measure is the absolute

20
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,946
square of Psi. This is the Probability Density function.

21
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,588
Where the graph is high, the probability of finding the particle is

22
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:11,699
high. Where it is zero, the particle will never be found.

23
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:15,182
To solve the equation, we must expand the

24
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:18,351
Hamiltonian operator. It consists of two main parts.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,157
The first term represents Kinetic Energy. It relates

26
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:23,208
to the curvature of the wave function.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,650
The second term, V of x, is the Potential

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,996
Energy. This describes the external forces acting on the

29
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,506
particle, like an electric field or a box.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,848
Let's apply this to a classic example: The Particle in a

31
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:39,735
Box. Imagine an electron trapped in a region with infinite walls.

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,851
Inside the box, the potential is zero. Outside, it is

33
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:46,028
infinite. The wave function must be zero at the walls.

34
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:49,084
The lowest energy state, or ground state, looks like

35
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:51,267
half a sine wave. This is n equals 1.

36
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,804
At higher energy, n equals 2, the wave gains a

37
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:56,673
full cycle. Notice the point in the middle where the

38
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,155
wave function is zero. This is called a node.

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,925
As we increase energy to n equals 3, the number of

40
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:06,255
nodes increases. The curvature increases, which implies higher kinetic energy.

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,959
The Schrödinger equation changed our understanding of reality.

42
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:14,668
It replaced specific trajectories with evolving probabilities.

43
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:18,539
Whether it's understanding atoms, designing lasers, or building quantum

44
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,484
computers, it all starts with this beautiful equation.
