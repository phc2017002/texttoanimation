00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,769
Welcome to this comprehensive explanation of the Schrödinger equation,

2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:07,031
one of the most fundamental equations in quantum mechanics.

3
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:09,945
This equation describes how quantum states evolve over

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,711
time and forms the foundation of quantum mechanics.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,712
Before we dive into the equation itself,

6
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,775
let's understand what a wave function is.

7
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,805
A wave function, denoted by the Greek letter psi, is a

8
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:24,689
mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a particle.

9
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,982
It depends on position x and time t.

10
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:30,430
The wave function itself is a complex-valued function.

11
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:33,259
Let's visualize what a wave function might look like.

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,458
Here's a simple example of a wave packet.

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,138
This wave packet represents the real part of a wave

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,301
function. It shows the wavelike nature of quantum particles.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,118
Now, let's introduce the time-dependent Schrödinger

16
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:46,610
equation in its full glory.

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,088
Here it is: i times the reduced Planck constant

18
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:51,788
times the partial derivative of psi with respect to

19
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:54,488
time equals the Hamiltonian operator acting on psi.

20
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,547
Let's break down each component of this

21
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:58,506
equation to understand what it means.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,999
The left side represents the time evolution of the wave function. The

23
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:07,303
i is the imaginary unit, and h-bar is the reduced Planck constant.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,247
The right side contains the Hamiltonian operator, which

25
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:12,498
represents the total energy of the system.

26
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,091
The Hamiltonian operator can be expanded into

27
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,524
kinetic energy and potential energy terms.

28
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,715
The first term is the kinetic energy operator, and the

29
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,263
second term V of x is the potential energy.

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,911
For many applications, we use the time-independent

31
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:29,944
Schrödinger equation, which applies to stationary states.

32
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,477
In this case, we can separate the wave function

33
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:34,426
into a spatial part and a time part.

34
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:38,460
This leads to the time-independent form: the Hamiltonian acting on psi

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,521
equals E times psi, where E is the energy eigenvalue.

36
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:44,403
Or, writing out the Hamiltonian explicitly, we get this

37
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:47,185
form with the second derivative and potential energy.

38
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:49,746
Now let's explore one of the

39
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:52,258
most important concepts: probability density.

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,863
According to the Born interpretation, the square of the absolute

41
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:59,195
value of the wave function gives us the probability density

42
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:01,680
of finding the particle at a given position.

43
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:06,560
This is a probability density, meaning the probability of finding the particle

44
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,320
in a small interval is P of x times delta x.

45
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:13,026
Let's visualize this relationship. First, we'll show a wave function.

46
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:16,490
Here's our wave function, oscillating with a Gaussian envelope.

47
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,181
Now, when we take the absolute value squared,

48
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:21,760
we get the probability density shown below.

49
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,071
Notice how the probability density is always positive and shows

50
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,496
where the particle is most likely to be found.

51
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,575
The total probability of finding the particle anywhere

52
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:33,151
must equal one. This is called normalization.

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,879
Let's discuss the physical interpretation and what the

54
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,609
Schrödinger equation tells us about quantum mechanics.

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,227
First, the Schrödinger equation is deterministic. If we know the wave function

56
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,253
at one time, we can calculate it at any other time.

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,232
However, the outcome of measurements is probabilistic.

58
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:53,049
We can only predict probabilities, not certainties.

59
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,327
Third, particles exhibit wave-particle duality. They show

60
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,563
wave-like behavior through interference and diffraction.

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,732
Finally, there's the uncertainty principle. We cannot simultaneously know

62
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:06,367
the exact position and momentum of a particle.

63
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:10,162
Let's apply the Schrödinger equation to a classic

64
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,244
example: a particle confined in a one-dimensional box.

65
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:17,183
Imagine a particle trapped between two infinitely high potential

66
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,528
walls at x equals zero and x equals L.

67
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,772
Inside the box, the potential energy is

68
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:25,185
zero, so the Schrödinger equation simplifies significantly.

69
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:28,311
The solutions are standing waves, similar to waves on a

70
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,269
string. The wave function must be zero at the walls.

71
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,920
Higher energy states have more nodes. Here's

72
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,935
the second energy level with two half-wavelengths.

73
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,599
And the third energy level with

74
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,694
three half-wavelengths fits in the box.

75
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:43,559
The energy levels are quantized, meaning only certain

76
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,218
discrete energy values are allowed. The energy of

77
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,389
each state is proportional to n squared.

78
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,857
Let's summarize what we've learned about the Schrödinger equation.

79
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,100
The Schrödinger equation is the fundamental equation of quantum

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,145
mechanics that describes how wave functions evolve in time.

81
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:02,550
Wave functions contain all information about a quantum system,

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,637
but they are complex-valued and not directly observable.

83
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,857
Probability densities, obtained by squaring the wave function,

84
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,197
tell us where we're likely to find particles.

85
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:15,014
Energy levels are often quantized, meaning only discrete values are

86
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,531
allowed, as we saw in the particle in a box.

87
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:20,481
This equation revolutionized physics and opened the door

88
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:23,498
to understanding atoms, molecules, and the quantum world.

89
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,524
